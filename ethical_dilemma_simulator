# Ethical Dilemma Simulator

## Project Overview
The Ethical Dilemma Simulator is designed to present users with ethical dilemmas and encourage critical thinking and discussion. This chatbot aims to facilitate deeper understanding of ethical reasoning.

## What You’ll Do

### 1. Design Dilemma Prompts
Frame ethical dilemmas effectively. Examples include:
- **Dilemma Introduction**: "Here’s a scenario: You find a wallet on the street with money inside. What do you do?"
- **Clarifying Questions**: "What factors influence your decision in this scenario?"

### 2. Encourage Discussion
Promote critical thinking:
- **Reasoning Prompts**: "Why do you think your choice is the right one?"
- **Counterpoint Questions**: "What if someone else had a different perspective?"

### 3. Provide Follow-Up Questions
Deepen the conversation:
- **Exploration Prompts**: "How would your decision change if this wallet belonged to a stranger versus a friend?"
- **Reflection Questions**: "What does this dilemma reveal about your values?"

## Conclusion
The Ethical Dilemma Simulator will challenge users to think critically about ethical issues and foster meaningful discussions.
