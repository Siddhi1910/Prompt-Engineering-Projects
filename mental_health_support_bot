# Mental Health Support Bot

## Project Overview
The Mental Health Support Bot is designed to provide basic mental health support and information about coping strategies. This chatbot aims to offer a safe space for users to express their feelings and receive empathetic responses.

## What You’ll Do

### 1. Develop Sensitive Prompts
Create empathetic prompts that encourage users to share their feelings. Examples include:
- **Emotional Check-In**: "How are you feeling today?"
- **Stress Reflection**: "What’s been on your mind lately?"
- **Coping Strategies**: "Have you tried any strategies to manage your stress?"

### 2. Optimize for Context
Ensure prompts lead to appropriate responses based on the user’s emotional state. This involves:
- **Contextual Awareness**: Tailor prompts based on previous user responses to provide relevant support.
- **Follow-Up Questions**: Use conditional prompts to address specific concerns, such as "I’m sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk more about it?"

### 3. Iterate on Conversations
Analyze conversations to find common user concerns and refine the prompts accordingly. This includes:
- **Data Analysis**: Regularly review chat logs to identify frequently discussed topics and emotional triggers.
- **Prompt Refinement**: Adjust prompts to better address the needs and concerns of users, enhancing overall support.

## Conclusion
By creating sensitive prompts and iterating on user interactions, the Mental Health Support Bot will serve as a valuable resource for individuals seeking support and information on mental well-being.
