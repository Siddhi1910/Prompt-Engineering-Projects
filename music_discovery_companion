# Music Discovery Companion

## Project Overview
The Music Discovery Companion is designed to help users discover new music based on their current favorites and mood. This chatbot aims to enhance users' musical experience by offering personalized suggestions.

## What You’ll Do

### 1. Create Preference Assessment Prompts
Gather information about user preferences. Examples include:

### 2. Suggest New Artists and Genres
Provide tailored recommendations:
- **Artist Recommendations**: "Based on your favorites, you might enjoy [new artist]."
- **Genre Exploration**: "Have you listened to [genre]? Here are some popular tracks."

### 3. Engage Users in Music Discussions
Encourage conversation about music:
- **Discussion Prompts**: "What’s the last song you added to your playlist?"
- **Feedback Requests**: "How do you feel about the recommendations I provided?"

## Conclusion
The Music Discovery Companion will enrich users' music experiences by connecting them with new sounds and artists based on their preferences.
