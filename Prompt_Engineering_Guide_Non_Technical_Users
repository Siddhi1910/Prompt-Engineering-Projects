# Prompt Engineering Guide for Non-Technical Users

## Description
A beginner-friendly guide to prompt engineering, focusing on practical tips for non-technical users. It covers prompt clarity, iteration techniques, and troubleshooting for effective communication with AI models.

## Suggested Outline

### 1. Introduction
- **Purpose**: Enable non-technical users to create effective prompts for a variety of tasks.
- **Audience**: Users with no technical background who want to harness the power of prompt engineering.

### 2. Basics of Prompt Engineering

- **Prompt Structure**:
  - **Example**: “Write a summary of [topic].” Clear structure leads to accurate responses.
  - **Expected Output**: A brief, relevant summary.

- **Prompt Phrasing**:
  - **Example**: “Explain [concept] in simple terms for a beginner.” Clear phrasing helps the AI provide information at an appropriate level.

- **Specificity**:
  - **Example**: “List three benefits of exercise for mental health.” Specific prompts yield more focused responses.

### 3. Iterating on Prompts

- **Initial Prompt**: “Summarize the benefits of remote work.”
- **Refinement 1**: “Summarize the benefits of remote work for productivity and work-life balance.”
- **Refinement 2**: “Summarize the benefits of remote work for productivity, work-life balance, and mental health.”
- **Explanation**: Each iteration refines the output to focus on more specific benefits.

### 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Issue**: Response is too general.
  - **Solution**: Add context to the prompt, e.g., “List three detailed reasons why remote work can increase productivity.”
  
- **Issue**: Irrelevant response.
  - **Solution**: Specify key points, e.g., “Provide a summary of the top three challenges in remote work.”

### 5. Examples of Prompt Evolution

- **Example Task**: Generate a customer service FAQ.
  - **Initial Prompt**: “Create a FAQ for customer service.”
  - **Refined Prompt**: “Create a FAQ for customer service that addresses common issues like refunds, cancellations, and product support.”

### Conclusion
This guide provides non-technical users with practical steps to create, refine, and troubleshoot prompts effectively. By focusing on clarity, iteration, and specificity, users can communicate better with AI to achieve the desired outcomes.
