# Travel Advisor Bot

## Project Overview
The Travel Advisor Bot is designed to offer travel advice, recommendations, and itineraries based on user preferences. This chatbot aims to enhance the travel planning experience by providing tailored suggestions.

## What You’ll Do

### 1. Personalization Prompts
Create prompts to gather user preferences. Examples include:
- **Activity Preferences**: "What type of activities do you enjoy while traveling? (e.g., adventure, relaxation, culture)"
- **Travel Duration**: "How long do you plan to travel?"
- **Destination Interests**: "Are there specific destinations you have in mind?"

### 2. Contextual Recommendations
Design prompts that provide tailored suggestions based on user inputs. This involves:
- **Custom Itineraries**: Based on preferences, prompt users with, "Here’s a sample itinerary for a week in [destination]. How does that sound?"
- **Local Recommendations**: Suggest activities or restaurants based on the user’s interests, e.g., "You mentioned you love art! Have you checked out the local galleries in [destination]?"

### 3. Iterate on Suggestions
Analyze user interactions to refine the prompts and improve the quality of recommendations. This includes:
- **User Feedback**: After a trip, ask users to rate their experiences with suggestions to gather insights.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update recommendation algorithms based on user feedback and trends in travel preferences.

## Conclusion
By personalizing travel advice and continually refining suggestions, the Travel Advisor Bot will provide a valuable tool for travelers seeking tailored experiences.
