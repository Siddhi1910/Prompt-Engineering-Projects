# Language Learning Companion

## Project Overview
The Language Learning Companion is designed to help users learn a new language by practicing conversation skills and vocabulary. This chatbot aims to facilitate language acquisition through interactive prompts and feedback.

## What You’ll Do

### 1. Create Conversation Prompts
Design prompts that encourage users to respond in the target language. Examples include:
- **Food Description**: "Describe your favorite food in [target language]."
- **Daily Activities**: "What did you do yesterday? Share your day in [target language]."
- **Opinion Questions**: "What do you think about learning new languages?"

### 2. Feedback Loop
Develop prompts that provide constructive feedback on grammar and vocabulary usage. This involves:
- **Error Correction**: Prompt users to correct their own sentences with feedback like, "That’s a good attempt! Can you find a better word for ‘happy’?"
- **Encouragement**: Offer positive reinforcement, such as "Great job! Your sentence structure is improving!"

### 3. Track Progress
Optimize prompts for tracking the user’s learning progress and adjusting difficulty levels accordingly. This includes:
- **Progress Assessment**: Regularly check users’ progress with questions like, "How confident do you feel about using the vocabulary we practiced?"
- **Adaptive Learning**: Modify prompts based on user performance to ensure they remain challenging yet achievable.

## Conclusion
Through interactive prompts and continuous feedback, the Language Learning Companion will enhance users' language skills and confidence in using their target language.
